Once you have found the hero models that you like, you can download them to your computer. Make sure to check the file format and compatibility of the hero models before downloading them. Most of the custom Dota 1 hero models are in .mdx or .mdl format, which are compatible with Warcraft III.
  
## Step 2: Install Dota 1 Hero Models
 
The second step is to install the Dota 1 hero models that you have downloaded. To do this, you will need a program that can edit Warcraft III files, such as [MPQ Editor](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/mpq-editor-v-3-5-2-799.245701/) or [Ladik's MPQ Editor](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/ladiks-mpq-editor-v-3-6-0-808.245701/). You can download these programs from their respective websites and install them on your computer.
 
After installing the program, you will need to locate the Warcraft III folder on your computer. This is usually located in C:\Program Files\Warcraft III or C:\Program Files (x86)\Warcraft III. Inside this folder, you will find a file named war3.mpq, which contains all the game data for Warcraft III.
 
You will need to open this file with the program that you have installed. You can do this by right-clicking on the file and selecting Open With... or by dragging and dropping the file into the program window. Once you have opened the file, you will see a list of folders and files inside it.
 
You will need to find the folder named Units inside the war3.mpq file. This folder contains all the hero models for Warcraft III. You will need to replace some of these files with the custom Dota 1 hero models that you have downloaded. To do this, you will need to know the file name of each hero model that you want to replace.

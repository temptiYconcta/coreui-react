## Step 1: Download Windows XP SP3 64-bit ISO file
 
You will need a Windows XP SP3 64-bit ISO file to install the operating system on VirtualBox. You can download it from various sources online, but make sure to check the integrity of the file with SHA1 or MD5 checksums. One possible source is [getintopc.com](http://getintopc.com/softwares/operating-systems/windows-xp-professional-sp3-32-bit-iso-dec-2016-download/), which provides a direct download link for the ISO file.
 
## Step 2: Install Oracle VM VirtualBox on your PC
 
You will also need to install Oracle VM VirtualBox on your PC if you don't have it already. You can download it from [virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and follow the installation wizard to complete the setup. You will need at least 4 GB of free disk space and 2 GB of RAM to run VirtualBox smoothly.
 
## Step 3: Create a new virtual machine for Windows XP
 
Once you have installed VirtualBox, launch it and click on the New button to create a new virtual machine. Type the name of the OS as Windows XP and select Windows XP (64-bit) as the version. The rest of the settings will be set by default. Click Next to continue.
 
On the next screen, you will need to allocate some memory (RAM) for the virtual machine. The recommended size is 512 MB, but you can increase it if you have enough RAM on your PC. Click Next to proceed.
 
On the next screen, you will need to create a virtual hard disk for the virtual machine. You can choose either a fixed size disk or a dynamically allocated disk. A fixed size disk will allocate a specific amount of space on your PC, while a dynamically allocated disk will grow as needed. The recommended size is 10 GB, but you can increase it if you have enough disk space on your PC. Click Next to continue.
 
On the next screen, you will need to choose a file location and format for the virtual hard disk. The default format is VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image), which is compatible with VirtualBox. You can also choose VHD (Virtual Hard Disk) or VMDK (Virtual Machine Disk) formats if you want to use the virtual disk with other software. Click Create to finish.
 
## Step 4: Mount Windows XP SP3 64-bit ISO file on VirtualBox
 
Now that you have created a virtual machine for Windows XP, you will need to mount the Windows XP SP3 64-bit ISO file on VirtualBox. To do this, select the virtual machine from the left panel and click on Settings. Go to Storage and click on the Empty slot under Controller: IDE. On the right side, click on the CD icon and choose Choose a Disk File. Browse to the location where you saved the Windows XP SP3 64-bit ISO file and select it. Click OK to save the changes.
 
## Step 5: Install Windows XP SP3 64-bit on VirtualBox
 
Now you are ready to install Windows XP SP3 64-bit on VirtualBox. To start the installation process, select the virtual machine from the left panel and click on Start. The virtual machine will boot from the ISO file and display a blue screen with some options. Press Enter to set up Windows XP.
 
On the next screen, press F8 to agree to the license agreement. On the next screen, press Enter to create a partition on the unpartitioned space. On the next screen, press Enter again to format the partition using NTFS file system (Quick). The installation process will begin and copy some files to the virtual hard disk.
 
After some time, the virtual machine will restart and continue with the installation process. You will see a graphical user interface

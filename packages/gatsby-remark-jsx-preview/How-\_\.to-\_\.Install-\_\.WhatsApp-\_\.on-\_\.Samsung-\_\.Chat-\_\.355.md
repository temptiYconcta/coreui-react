Samsung Chat 355 is a feature phone that runs on a proprietary operating system. It does not support Android apps, which means you cannot download WhatsApp from the official website[^1^] or the Google Play Store[^2^]. However, there is a way to install WhatsApp on your Samsung Chat 355 using a Java archive (JAR) file.
 
A JAR file is a compressed file that contains Java applications or libraries. Some feature phones can run JAR files as standalone apps. To install WhatsApp on your Samsung Chat 355 using a JAR file, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the WhatsApp JAR file from a trusted source. You can use your computer or another phone to do this. Make sure the file name ends with .jar and not .zip or .rar.
